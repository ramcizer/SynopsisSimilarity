# SynopsisSimilarity
A comparison of one synopsis against ten others to see which has the highest similarity.

Requirement: The watchnext.py requires the movies.txt to read from so if you run it make sure that they are in the same folder. 

Further details: 

A Planet Hulk synopsis is evaluated in relations to ten other synopsis so as to detail which synopsis it is most alike and least alike. 
The results would suggest, if a movie watcher wanted to watch another similar movie, that the most alike movies is the one that they would choose to watch next. 
Similarly, the least alike is probably the movie watcher would not want to watch next. 

The program prepares the text into a dictionary so that it can evaluate, order then print out the two main results.
